# FYP Documentation Repository

## Multi-Sport Athlete Injury Surveillance System

Documentation repository for my Final Year Project at Atlantic Technological University. This repository contains comprehensive technical documentation, interactive visualizations, and architectural diagrams for a privacy-focused sports injury tracking system.

---

## Project Overview

This system provides a complete solution for tracking and analyzing sports-related injuries across multiple sports, teams, and organizations while maintaining strict GDPR compliance and data privacy standards.

### Key Features

- Privacy-first architecture with pseudonymization of all personally identifiable information
- Comprehensive injury tracking from occurrence through treatment to resolution
- Multi-sport and multi-team support with flexible organizational structures
- Complete audit trail for compliance and access monitoring
- Temporal analysis capabilities for identifying injury patterns

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: Neo4j (Graph Database)
- **Identity Management**: Separate secure database for PII storage

---

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

- **[Neo4j Database Documentation](neo4j_database_documentation.md)** - Complete database schema, node definitions, relationships, query examples, and integration guidelines. This is the primary technical reference for the system's data architecture.

### Interactive Resources

The following HTML-based interactive documentation is hosted via GitHub Pages and provides visual exploration of the system:

- **[Interactive Neo4j Schema](https://nathan-dean371.github.io/FYP-Documentation-Repo/Html%20Docs/Neo4j-Schema-Interactive.html)** - Visual representation of all database nodes, relationships, and properties. Use this to understand the complete database structure and explore entity connections.

- **[API Endpoints Documentation](https://nathan-dean371.github.io/FYP-Documentation-Repo/Html%20Docs/api_endpoints.html)** - Complete API reference including request/response examples, authentication requirements, and error handling specifications.

### Visual Assets

- **SVG Diagrams** - Static screen mockups and architectural diagrams stored in the repository root for reference in documentation.

## Privacy Architecture

This system implements a two-database architecture to ensure complete separation of personally identifiable information from analytical data:

### Neo4j Graph Database
Stores pseudonymized identifiers, relationships between entities, coded injury data, and aggregated statistics suitable for analysis.

### Identity Service (SQL)
Maintains the mapping between pseudonymous IDs and real personal information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and emergency contacts.

### Access Pattern
When displaying data, the backend fetches pseudonymized data from Neo4j and resolves real identities only when authorized and necessary, with all access logged for compliance.

---

## Database Schema Summary

The system uses 11 core node types in Neo4j:

### Core Entities
- **Player** - Athletes being monitored (pseudonymized)
- **Injury** - Injury incidents with detailed tracking
- **StatusUpdate** - Ongoing health status monitoring
- **Session** - Training and match sessions

### Organizational Entities
- **Team** - Sports teams
- **Sport** - Sport types and classifications
- **Organization** - Clubs, academies, and federations
- **Coach** - Medical and coaching staff

### Administrative Entities
- **Admin** - System administrators
- **Role** - Permission and access control
- **AuditLog** - Compliance and access tracking

For detailed property definitions, relationships, and query examples, see the [Neo4j Database Documentation](neo4j_database_documentation.md).

## Key Design Principles

### Privacy by Design
- Pseudonymization of all personally identifiable information
- Data minimization - only essential data stored in graph database
- K-anonymity through generalized attributes (age groups, regions)
- Complete separation of PII from analytical data

### GDPR Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging for all data access
- Right to erasure support through pseudonym deletion
- Purpose limitation through coded data structures
- Data portability through structured export capabilities

### Security
- No sensitive personal information in Neo4j
- No free-text fields that could contain identifying information
- Standardized, coded values for all medical data
- Encrypted connections between all system components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this documentation:
- Modern web browser for viewing interactive HTML documentation
- Markdown viewer for documentation files
- Neo4j Desktop or Neo4j Aura (for implementing the database)
- Node.js and NestJS (for backend implementation)

### Viewing Documentation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `neo4j_database_documentation.md` for complete technical reference
3. Visit the interactive documentation links above for visual exploration
4. Review SVG diagrams for screen mockups and architecture overviews

### Implementing the Database

Refer to the [Setup Instructions](neo4j_database_documentation.md#setup-instructions) section in the Neo4j documentation for step-by-step guidance on creating the database schema, setting up constraints and indexes, and initializing sample data.

## Use Cases

This system supports multiple use cases:

### For Medical Staff
- Track player injuries and recovery progress
- Monitor treatment effectiveness
- Access historical injury data for informed decision-making
- Generate reports for insurance and compliance

### For Coaches
- View player availability and fitness status
- Plan training loads based on injury history
- Make informed selection decisions
- Monitor recovery timelines

### For Administrators
- Generate aggregate statistics and reports
- Identify injury trends across teams and sports
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Manage access permissions and audit logs

### For Researchers
- Analyze anonymized injury patterns
- Study effectiveness of prevention strategies
- Compare injury rates across sports and age groups
- Investigate risk factors (all with proper ethical approval)

---

## Privacy Considerations

### What is NOT Stored in Neo4j

- Real names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Home addresses
- Dates of birth (age groups used instead)
- Free-text medical notes
- Any personally identifiable information

### Access Control

All access to player data is logged in AuditLog nodes. The system supports role-based access control with different permission levels:
- Admins can view aggregated statistics
- Coaches can view their team's players
- Medical staff can view detailed injury information
- Research access requires specific purpose documentation

---

## Integration Guidelines
