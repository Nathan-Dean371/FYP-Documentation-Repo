To-be completed: 
- Mobile App screens/views
- Back-end API endpoint's
- Database Schema Design

Planned out 3 steps of screens, MVP, nice to have & future. 
Helps greatly scope the mobile app. 
Next step is too create these screens in figma, very broad design, not getting caught up in details first. 

Got Claude to generate 3 random screens as a quick look into the future look of the app.
